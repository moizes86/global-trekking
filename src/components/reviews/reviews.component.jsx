      <p>
        Upon arrival we were warmly welcomed by Guide Jan Shai , our names were
        mentioned on the board and we felt welcomed and with such a friendly
        atmosphere we had a fantastic start!

        The guide and tour was extremely good, very flexible (appreciate this!)
        and for that she deserves a special thanks. We had two great days there,
        which obviously also added up to the experience.

        Nico is such a warm personality and highly motivated guide
        (recommendable!). I truly enjoyed walking the six of us through the
        area. The scenery was beautiful and it was a relieve to walk in such a
        quiet and peaceful environment.
